# Perfect-Timing
Two web-based stopwatches (one counting up and the other counting down), using JavaScript.

Usage: Each stopwatch obeys its own start/pause button and reset button.
       For the first time: set time in the input field, click start to start specified watch.
       Each time after, changing value in input field will not interrupt watches. Click 'reset' if want to change target time.
